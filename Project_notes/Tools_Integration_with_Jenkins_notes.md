1. Navigate to **Manage Google Account** > **Security**.
2. Click on **2-Step Verification**.
3. Scroll down to **App Password** and click on it.
4. Follow the instructions displayed to create an App password. Remember to save this password as it will be displayed only once. For example, your App password might look something like this: `inbz lqez dwfx dhxh`.

## Plugin üß©

The **Email Extension Plugin** is included by default in recent versions of Jenkins, which simplifies the process of setting up email notifications for your builds.

## Credentials Setup üîë

To set up the credentials in Jenkins:

1. Go to **Jenkins Dashboard** > **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Credentials**.
2. Click on **(global)** under **Stores scoped to Jenkins**.
3. Click on **Add Credentials** on the left side.
4. In the **Kind** dropdown, select **Username with password**.
5. In the **Username** field, enter your Gmail username. In the **Password** field, enter your App password (not your Gmail password).
6. In the **ID** field, enter a unique ID for this credential (e.g., `gmail`).
7. Click **OK** to save the credential.



To configure the email notification:

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**.

# GitHub Webhook Integration with Jenkins üöÄ

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

1. An existing GitHub account and a project repository.
2. Jenkins installed and running on your system.

> Note: The Git plugins come pre-installed with Jenkins, simplifying the setup process.

## Configuration Steps üîß

Follow these steps to configure the GitHub webhook with Jenkins:

1. **Copy the Jenkins URL**:
   - For example, `http://localhost:9082`. Note that in this example, a custom port is used instead of the default Jenkins port 8080.

2. **Navigate to your project repository on GitHub**:
   - Click on **Settings** at the repository level.

3. **Go to Webhooks & services**:
   - Click on **Add webhook**.

4. **Fill in the required fields**:
   - **Payload URL**: Enter your Jenkins URL followed by `/github-webhook`. For example, `<JenkinsURL>/github-webhook`.
   - **Content type**: Select `application/json`.
   - Leave the remaining fields as they are unless there are specific requirements for your project.

## Making Localhost Public Using CloudFlare ‚òÅÔ∏è

### Prerequisites:

Before you start, ensure that you have the following:

1. The CloudFlare application downloaded on your machine.
2. Jenkins installed and running on your system.

### How to Use:

1. **Download `cloudflared` onto your machine**:
   - You can find the appropriate package for your operating system on the [downloads page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/).
   - For Windows, use this [direct link to download the executable](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe).

2. **Rename the downloaded package**:
   - Name it `cloudflared.exe`.

3. **Open PowerShell**:
   - Change the directory to your Downloads folder.
   - Run the command: `.\cloudflared.exe --version`.
   - This should output the version of `cloudflared`, for example: `cloudflared version 2024.3.0 (built 2024-03-20-1009 UTC)`.

> Note: The executable could be named `cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe` or `cloudflared-windows-386.exe` if you haven't renamed it.

üåê Now your localhost is accessible from the public internet using CloudFlare!

---

# Making Jenkins URL Public üåê

To make your Jenkins URL public, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the CloudFlare directory**:
   - Run the command: `.\cloudflared.exe --url localhost:9081`.
   - This will generate a public URL, for example: [https://sa-luxury-impacts-chevy.trycloudflare.com](https://sa-luxury-impacts-chevy.trycloudflare.com).

## Why Use Cloudflare? ‚òÅÔ∏è

Webhooks generally do not work with `localhost:<Port-Num>` because it only has local internet access. To use webhooks, you need to convert the localhost to a public host. After researching several applications, Cloudflare was found to be user-friendly and easy to set up.

> **Note**:
> - You did not specify any valid additional argument to the Cloudflare tunnel command.
> - If you are trying to run a Quick Tunnel, you need to explicitly pass the `--URL` flag.
>   - For example: `cloudflared tunnel --URL localhost:8080/`.
> - Please note that Quick Tunnels are meant to be ephemeral and should only be used for testing purposes.
> - For production usage, we recommend creating Named Tunnels. [Learn more](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/)
